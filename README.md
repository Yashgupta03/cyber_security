# Cyber_security

I have uploaded sample of my work which i did and relevant for Power-grid type of attack only.
So for this i have made 3 folders namely-: 

a. Attack-: In this I have uploaded only one file named Password_sniffing.py which is used to get access to user password by using brute force technique of checking corresponding username and password in file defaults.txt

b. Defence-: In this I have uploaded 2 files namely-:
    (i) Network_scanning.py: which perform Synscan and Dns Scan
    (ii)encryption_decryption.py: which encrypt the data transfer and correspondingly decrypt, both code are there marked by comment.

c. Dummy_malware-: This is the folder which contains malware which I made, which actually obfuscate user .py files in local current directories and store all the code in the form of space seperated list, and join the virus_code to user .py file and payload with infinite loop of print statements.
And folder Ransomware which has code for encryption and decryption and .key file for key and one txt file for testing.
